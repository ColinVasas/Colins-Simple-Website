            <h1>Projects so far</h1>
            <p>This is a small collection going over some of the work I already have in my portfolio but I have it more visually here.</p>
            <h2>National Park Website</h2>
            <p>This is a website group project where we were tasked with creating a website that had connecting data in a database. We were tasked with creating a API for the 4 Data sets that we were supposed to have. Our team made a national park website(similar to yelp but for parks).</p>

                <img class="center"
                    src="images/ExLocationList.PNG" width="50%"
                    alt=""
                    title="LocationList"
                >
            <br><p class="center-text"><i>List of the locations</i></p>
        </div>
            <p>My job was to have a List of locations that connected directly to Parks, so when a park was created you could assign it a location so on both the location and park page they would display eachother.</p>
            <div>
                <img class="center"
                    src="images/ExLocation.PNG" width="80%"
                    alt=""
                    title="California Location"
                >
            <br><p class="center-text"><i>This is what would appear when you click on the California link. In this image you can also see a list of the parks that appear underneath. Those links are done by the api not manually.</i></p>
        </div>
        <p>The last thing I did for this website was I was tasked with creating something unique(it was very open ended.) So I used an openAPI that was already created to be able to find the distance between a park and a given zipcode.</p>

        <h2>Unity Game Project</h2>
        <p>Me and a small team of fellow CS majors at Chemeketa started working on our dream game. It is a survival/rpg game similar to games such as valheim and even minecraft. The special part of this game is the armor, weapons, attacks and everything is all based on elemental attacks.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class = "center">
                <img
                    src="images/CubeKiller.PNG"
                    width="100%"
                    alt="week 1"
                    title="Week 1 Progress"
                >
                <br><i>This was week 1 of our meeting where we put together a small platfom a killable cubes.</i>
            </div>
        </div>
          <p>My tasks in this team has been to plan the development of the game and give everyone on the team tasks every week. Aside from managing the team I primarily work on the movement of the player and UI/inventory system of the character.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class = "box-right">
                <img
                    src="images/ProjectEX.PNG"
                    width="100%"
                    alt="Final week"
                    title="Most recent week"
                >
                <br><i>final week of progress</i>
            </div>
        <p>This is a screenshot of where we are now in the game. As you can see there wasn't much progress in the models(mostly because we're all programmers) but other than that we have a basic combat and inventory system then also a working world generation system.</p>
