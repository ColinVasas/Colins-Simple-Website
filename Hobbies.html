        <h1>Hobby</h1>
            <p>When it comes to hobbies I have many. I enjoy a lot of things people would consider "nerdy" like Dungeons and Dragons and video games but I also enjoy things people consider normal such as football and Weightlifting. The hobbie I will be talking about is one that started "nerdy" but has now became a big part of pop culture, <strong>Anime.</strong></p>

        <h2>How it Started</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <div class = "box-right">
                <img
                    src="images/GokuVsFreiza.png"
                    width="100%"
                    alt="The fight of goku against freiza"
                    title="The Second Super Saiyan in History"
                >
                <br><i>This was a monumental moment in the anime where goku first turns super saiyan, a long awaited transformation that was rumored about.(This is also the section of the anime I was at when I was on facetime with that girl).</i>
            </div>
            <p>My addiction to anime first started in 8th grade when a couple of my best friends convinced me to begin watching an anime called <i>Dragon Ball Z</i>. While I did make fun of those friends in the beginning for watching anime I decided to give it a shot anyways and then I was hooked. I couldn't stop watching it, there was something about this show that was like no other. I was so hooked that one night a girl facetimed me that I was interested in at the time but I wasn't listening to a word she was saying all night because I was so hooked with what was happening in the anime at the time.</p> 

            <p>After watching it all I figured it was just one special show and that no other anime would compare. I was soon proven wrong when my friends convinced me to watch what I now annouce as one of the top 3 greatest stories/shows of all time, Naruto. This proved to me that anime really is amazing and I began watching more and more of it.</p>

            <h2>Anime Hall of Fame</h2>
            <p>After watching as much anime as I have, I have began to create some what of a favorite's list for different reasons. These are the ones you will always see  me recommend.</p>
            <div class="d-lg-flex">
                <div>
                    <h3>Action</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attack On Titan - One of the best stories I've ever watched. It can be a messed of show but it's so intense it's worth it. </li>
                        <li>Jujustsu Kaisen - Very good action anime. It can be serious and sad at times so don't get too attached to the characters but it's very good.</li>
                        <li>Naruto - This story is a journey that has you rooting for an underdog but also convince you anything is possible.</li>
                        <li>Berserk - Not an anime, a manga, but... It's pure pain...</li>
                        <li>Seven Deadly Sins - Really cool story but the animation is only okay. The only reason I recommend it is because it has one of my favorite characters in it. <strong>Escanor, The Lion Sin of Pride</strong></li>
                        <li>Dragon Ball Z - I have to put this on here because it was my first and I still base characters I make in video games off of these guys.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Slice of Life</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Toradora - An amazing life anime about some high schoolers going through school facing everyday drama. </li>
                        <li>Your lie in april - This is a beautiful show about the journey of a kid who lost his ability to hear music and a girl helping him regain his lost ability.</li>
                        <li>Mob Psycho 100 - This is about a kid who has basically the powers of a god but tries not to use them too much and make it without them.</li>
                        <li>Horimiya - One of my favorite if not favorite slice of life anime. It's about a kid who was always kind of an outcast and becomes friends with the popular kids. It's very good and I've watched it several times.</li>
                        <li>Gamers - It's a show about gamers... That's pretty much it but it's good.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Isekai</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shield Hero - This is an anime about a guy who gets brought into a different world as the hero of the shield. He can't really attack but he uses his witts and resources to survive. </li>
                        <li>Mushoku Tensei - This one is about a guy who reincarnates after dying and uses his knowledge of video games and such to propel his progress in this world.</li>
                        <li>Reincarnated as a slime - A man is reincarnated as a slime and uses his unique abilities as a slime to grow a city and take the world to better times.</li>
                        <li>Konosuba - An absolutely hilarious take on the genre. Super funny and that's all that needs to be said about that one.</li>
                        <li>Overlord - It takes the perspective of the villian with this approach.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Pop Culture Changes</h2>
        <p>One of the really cool changes that have happened with anime is you can see many elementry to young adults wearing anime shirts. Anyone can relate with anime and I think it's awesome. The coolest one for me is people are finding inspiration with the gym in these anime characters. While the physiques are unrealistic I still think the mentality of these characters is really motivating. </p>
        <div>
            <div class="box">
                <img
                    width="100%"
                    src="images/toji.jpg"
                    alt="Comic panel of Toji Fushiguro"
                    title="Toji Fushiguro"
                >
                <br><i>A picture of the character I am trying to cosplay as by next year. His name is Toji Fushiguro and he's a character from the anime Jujustsu Kaisen.</i>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Plenty of gym rats have looked to these insane mindsets in the gym due to these anime characters. A lot of them are aspiring to look like these characters as well. I personally am looking to look like a character by the beginning of next year so I can hopefully attend a comicon as him.</p>

                <p>In the end I think it's really cool that people of all kinds can relate to this really cool hobby in positive ways. Both to just enjoy the shows and to also look up to these characters in a positive way.</p>
