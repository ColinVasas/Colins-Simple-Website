		<h3>About me</h3>
		I've always been considered quite the nerd so most of my free time is spent either playing video games, watching youtube, or working on my personal game. Outside of that my favorite hobbies are playing Dungeons and Dragons, and playing board games with friends. Games I would recommend people play are Valorant, Overwatch, Rust, Minecraft, and Wizard of Legend. I also really like spending time with friends and doing really any activities with them but our main one is going out and trying new restaurants. I also have been involved in music my whole life so I enjoy relaxing at times and playing a little bit of piano.
